I realized a Symfony Project to create an online 

#Real Estate Agency: Carcassonne Immo.

This website will allow people to make a search with keywords to sort the property they're looking for.

This website has basically three pages:

An index page found at localhost:8000

A listing page for all the Homes and Properties ( for Rent or for Sale )

A page detailing a specific ad with title, price, number of rooms, description and a picture of the property.

I also implemented a fully fonctionnal Back End using EasyAdminBundle to be able to fully administrate this website.

I installed:

FosUserBundle to manage the users,

AsseticBundle to add Bootstrap for an easy way to deal with the Front End look,

EasyAdminBundle a simple admin generator to manage the Back End,

VichUploadBundle to be able to add pictures to the ads,

I also wanted to add gumlet, a php-image-resize but did not have time to configure it.
